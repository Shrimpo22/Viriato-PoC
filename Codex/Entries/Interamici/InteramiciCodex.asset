  displayName: The Interamici
  description: "The Interamici\u2014literally \u201Cthose between the waters\u201D\u2014lived
    on the high ridges and river valleys where Galicia meets Tr\xE1s-os-Montes. Their
    country lay between great streams and their headwaters: the Minho and Sil to
    the north, and the Limia and T\xE2mega rising to the south, a maze of torrents
    that gave the tribe its name and its temper. They spoke and fought like other
    Gallaecian peoples of the far northwest, sheltering in stone hillforts (castros)
    and ranging down to the fields and river tracks when season and war allowed.
    \r\n\r\nRome learned their name in the same breath as their neighbors. From Aquae
    Flaviae\u2014modern Chaves\u2014the imperial road system pressed into the interior,
    and on the city\u2019s great bridge a stone pillar (the Padr\xE3o dos Povos)
    listed the dependent communities. Among them stand the Interamici, counted with
    Limici, Tamagani, Equaesi, Querquerni and others, proof that their hills and
    crossings were folded into Rome\u2019s paperwork as well as its marches. \r\n\r\nLittle
    survives of their own voice beyond place-names and the hard outlines of hillfort
    walls. But the pattern is clear enough: a people set between rivers, trading
    salt, ore, and pasture, resisting until resistance cost more than it paid, then
    negotiating a place within the Roman map. Where their tracks met the Roman road,
    shrines and milestones followed; where their castros watched the valleys, they
    watched still, but now under new law. The Interamici endured the way their land
    endures\u2014by flowing around harder things."

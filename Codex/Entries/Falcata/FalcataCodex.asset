  displayName: Falcata
  description: "They forged it for close work in broken ground: a single-edged blade
    that swoops forward like a hawk, heavy at the tip, keen along the belly. Iberian
    smiths made the falcata to bite through shields and bone with a chopping draw-cut
    yet keep a stabbing point for the finish. Its grip often curled into a hook or
    enclosed guard, sometimes cast as an animal\u2019s head, locking the hand behind
    the weight of the blow. In form it echoes the Greek kopis, but Iberian examples
    are their own breed\u2014many sharpened on both edges toward the tip, tuned for
    the crush and tangle of hand-to-hand fighting. \r\n\r\nThe sword belongs to the
    centuries before Rome conquered Hispania\u2014common from the 5th to 1st century
    BCE\u2014and it traveled in grave goods as much as on campaigns. To carry a falcata
    was to carry status: silvered mounts, inlaid motifs, and careful heat-treating
    tell of weapons made to impress the living and arm the dead. Museums describe
    them as compact, efficient killers\u2014built to cut and stab\u2014and also as
    emblems of rank among Iberian and Celtiberian elites. \r\n\r\nRoman writers learned
    to respect the swords of Hispania, and armies that marched through the northwest
    met hillfort warriors who fought with javelin and blade, then fell back along
    goat tracks their pursuers feared. In those fights the falcata\u2019s forward
    balance and short length made sense: strike hard in close, from the shoulder,
    where a long spear is clumsy and a straight sword is slow. Later, as Rome folded
    the tribes into its order, the falcata faded from the battlefield, but the steel
    remained in graves and riverbeds\u2014and in the reputation of a people who knew
    how to make a short blade do ruinous work."

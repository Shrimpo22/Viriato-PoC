  displayName: Galba's Massacre
  description: "They came to the Roman camp unarmed, hungry, and hopeful. Servius
    Sulpicius Galba\u2014Rome\u2019s praetor in Farther Spain\u2014had promised the
    Lusitanians new land and safe terms if they laid down their weapons and resettled.
    He divided them into three groups on open ground, had trenches dug around them,
    and then gave a different order. The legionaries advanced.\r\n\r\nWhat followed
    was butchery. Men of fighting age were cut down; many of the rest were seized
    and sold across the sea. The numbers preserved by our sources vary wildly\u2014ancient
    writers speak in tens of thousands\u2014but all agree on the treachery and scale
    of the killing. Among those who escaped, tradition places a young warrior named
    Viriathus, who would soon ignite the most stubborn resistance Rome ever faced
    in the west. \r\n\r\nGalba\u2019s act did not pacify Lusitania. It enraged it.
    Raids swelled into open war that burned for years, the \u201CFiery War\u201D
    of Greek memory. Viriathus learned Rome\u2019s habits and punished Roman columns
    with ambush and flight, turning the hills and scrub into his allies and giving
    the Republic a guerrilla war it could neither crush nor ignore. \r\n\r\nBack
    in Rome, outrage followed the news. In 149 BC the tribune Lucius Scribonius Libo
    brought Galba to trial; Cato the Elder thundered against him. Galba escaped conviction\u2014ancient
    accounts credit a masterful speech and generous \u201Cgifts\u201D\u2014but his
    name was forever linked to the massacre that birthed Viriathus\u2019s rebellion. "

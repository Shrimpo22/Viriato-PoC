  description: "The Romans made an art of finishing a battle at arm\u2019s length.
    Their short sword\u2014the gladius\u2014was built for that moment when the line
    closed: a broad, double-edged blade with a strong point, short enough to work
    behind the shelter of the tall scutum. In the drill books and in the press of
    real fights, legionaries learned to thrust first and often, cutting only when
    a chance opened. In formation the weapon\u2019s economy mattered more than reach;
    its job was to end arguments quickly.\r\n\r\nRome did not invent it. During the
    Punic Wars they met Iberian swordsmen and took their pattern\u2014the gladius
    hispaniensis\u2014then refined it through several styles: the wasp-waisted Mainz
    and Fulham types with pronounced points, and, later, the straight-sided Pompeii
    type common in the early empire. Over the centuries the blade hovered around
    two feet in length; by the third century CE the army favored the longer spatha,
    but the gladius had already carved Rome\u2019s reputation. \r\n\r\nIn the arena
    the word \u201Cgladius\u201D named both weapon and spectacle, but its true theater
    was the line of the legion: pila cast, shields locked, a few brutal steps forward,
    then steel working in tight spaces. That rhythm\u2014throw, close, thrust\u2014was
    as much logistics and training as courage, and the gladius was the instrument
    that made it routine. "

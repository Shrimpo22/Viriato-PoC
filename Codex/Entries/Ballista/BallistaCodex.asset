  description: "The Romans called their precision engines ballistae and built them
    not as giant bows but as machines of twisted sinew and measured rule. Two rigid
    frames held skeins of animal tendon; short arms passed through those cords, storing
    energy as they were wound back and loosed. A slider ran between the frames, hauled
    by winch and ratchet until a sear released with a clean snap. From the groove
    a bolt leapt\u2014iron-headed, often square in section for splitting wood and
    shield\u2014fletched to hold its line in the air. Heavier frames threw stones,
    rounded or roughly dressed, to shatter hoardings and parapets. Roman engineers
    did not leave performance to chance: following the proportional canons described
    by writers like Vitruvius, they sized arms, skeins, and stroke so crews could
    reproduce a known effect by measure rather than guess.\n\nA trained ballistarius
    crew\u2014often rated as immunes, exempt from common fatigue duties\u2014worked
    by drill: wind, load, set elevation, mark fall of shot, walk the impacts onto
    target. In sieges the engine became the day\u2019s heartbeat, clearing battlements,
    shielding sappers, answering hostile artillery, and worrying gates until joinery
    failed. In the field it shaped ground and time, denying fords and street mouths,
    breaking dense bodies before contact so legionaries met an unsteady foe. The
    weapon also imposed a psychology: men who had seen a line raked by bolts learned
    to keep low or keep moving when its frame turned their way.\n\nOn Iberian soil\u2014where
    Roman arms contended with Celtiberian towns and hill tribes\u2014artillery like
    this appears wherever Rome tightened a ring. At Numantia the siege train screened
    earthworks and punished sorties, narrowing the city\u2019s options day by day.
    Against fast fighters in broken country, the ballista served less to pursue and
    more to fix: hold a path in iron, make a ridge too costly to crest, herd skirmishers
    toward ground the legions preferred. The machine\u2019s limits were practical
    and well known. Humidity slackened sinew and stole range; crews kept skeins covered,
    oiled, and constantly re-tuned. Recoil racked frames out of square; wedges crept;
    a warped arm or mismatched skeins spoiled accuracy and had to be corrected before
    the next shot. Logistics shadowed every advance: spare arms and cordage, ironwork
    for triggers, stacks of prepared bolts and stones, and artificers to keep the
    line firing.\n\nRoman practice produced families of engines rather than a single
    type. Light scorpiones specialized in anti-personnel work and could be spread
    down to smaller units; medium ballistae served both bolt and stone; and cart-mounted
    carroballistae, the kind paraded on Trajan\u2019s Column, followed columns to
    bring controlled fire wherever the line bent. Later centuries would favor the
    onager, a single-armed torsion sling quite different in feel and purpose, but
    in the Republican and early Imperial wars the two-armed ballista remained the
    disciplined face of Roman precision fire: a rule-bound machine that turned proportion
    into reach, and reach into advantage."

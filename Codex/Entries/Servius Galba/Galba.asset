  displayName: Praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba
  description: "A praetor was a senior Roman magistrate holding imperium\u2014the
    authority to command armies and administer justice. Praetors often governed provinces
    and could act as generals when the consuls were absent.\n\nGalba in Hispania
    (151\u2013150 BCE).\nAs praetor of Hispania Ulterior, Servius Sulpicius Galba
    inherited a grinding frontier war against the Lusitanians. After setbacks and
    supply strain, he offered them peace and new lands if they laid down their arms.
    The Lusitanians accepted; Galba ordered them divided into three \u201Csettlement
    groups\u201D on an open plain\u2014then ringed each group with legionaries. At
    his signal the Romans fell upon them. Thousands were killed; many survivors were
    sold into slavery. Among those who escaped, tradition places a young Viriathus,
    whose later rebellion would haunt Roman commanders for a decade.\n\nAftermath
    and legacy.\nBack in Rome (149 BCE), Galba was prosecuted for treachery and mass
    murder. The elder Cato denounced him fiercely, yet Galba swayed the people by
    pleading his hardships and parading his children; he was acquitted and later
    reached the consulship (144 BCE). In Iberia, however, his name became a byword
    for broken faith. Galba\u2019s stratagem bought a momentary victory\u2014but
    it ignited the wider Lusitanian War and helped forge Viriathus into Rome\u2019s
    most formidable Iberian foe."

  displayName: The Romans
  description: "They named their state for the Senate and the People of Rome\u2014SPQR\u2014and
    imagined politics as a contract between those two poles. From a quarrelsome city
    on the Tiber they learned to make victory permanent: defeat an enemy, pave a
    road, post a garrison, write the treaty\u2014and keep going. Their armies moved
    like workshops, throwing heavy pila to break a line and closing with the short
    gladius, while engineers measured out forts, bridges, and siegeworks as if they
    were streets yet to be built. The result was not quiet so much as order: caravans
    rolling farther, taxes counted more reliably, messages flashing along the road
    system and into stone and law. \r\n\r\nThey carried water across valleys on aqueducts,
    tunneled it through hills, and stitched provinces to Rome with milestones and
    relays; what looked like conquest from the outside felt like paperwork from within.
    To be Roman, first, was to be under Roman law\u2014and increasingly, to be a
    Roman citizen. Over generations the franchise widened, until Caracalla\u2019s
    edict of AD 212 swept almost every free person inside the circle. \r\n\r\nAt
    the top stood emperors who claimed to restore the republic while quietly replacing
    it, and for two long centuries\u2014the Pax Romana, from 27 BCE to 180 CE\u2014the
    Mediterranean mostly bent to the rhythm of Roman timetables. The symbol was the
    eagle standard on campaign; the feeling was arriving at a town you had never
    seen and knowing where the forum would be. Their dream was simple: a world arranged
    in straight lines and right angles, where the Senate and People of Rome wrote
    the headings and everyone else learned to fill in the forms. "

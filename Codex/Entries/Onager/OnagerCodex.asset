  description: "The onager was Rome\u2019s late antique answer to the problem of
    hurling heavy stones with brutal simplicity\u2014a single-armed torsion engine
    that kicked so hard on release it earned the name of a wild ass. Where the two-armed
    ballista sought proportion and precision, the onager embraced shock. A stout
    frame held one skein of twisted sinew; through it ran a thick throwing arm, hauled
    down by winch and ratchet until the crew felt the cords bite. At the end of that
    arm sat a sling or spoon, cradling a dressed stone. When the sear dropped, the
    arm snapped upward, the sling flicked free, and the stone took its line with
    the hard, flat sound of air parting around weight.\n\nWriters of the later Empire
    describe ugly recoil. An unbraced onager could walk back or break its own timbers;
    crews set them in earth beds or heaped ramped sod against the rear and sides,
    shimming the frame between shots to keep it square. Wet weather slackened the
    sinew; the men kept covers on the bundle, oiled the cords, and re-tuned the arm
    by wedges and keys. Rate of fire was modest\u2014weight over cadence\u2014but
    the effect on masonry and morale was plain: battlements shattered; hoardings
    came down; towers lost teeth. Compared to a ballista it was cruder in aim, yet
    perfectly suited to siege rhythm, where one good hit counted for many small punctures.\n\nIn
    the field the onager was more a battering presence than a ranging piece. Commanders
    used it to deny a gate mouth or to disturb a tight block of troops forming under
    walls; the stone\u2019s steep arc made defenders hunch, and any direct strike
    among men or carts turned a moment into a mess. Manuals insist on method\u2014fixed
    bed, consistent pull, careful stone weight, and a clean sling\u2014that turned
    a capricious beast into something a crew could predict. Ammunition was the simplest
    logistics: stone cut, dressed, and stacked by the hundred near the platform;
    spare slings coiled dry; iron fittings checked for creep and crack.\n\nChronology
    matters. In Republican wars and the early Empire, the two-armed ballista dominated
    precision work. The onager belongs later\u2014Vegetius\u2019s era\u2014when stone-throwing
    engines stood as the common grammar of sieges and the army relied on rugged machines
    that could be built from timbers at hand, set in earth, and repaired by artificers
    under fire. If a ballista was the surgeon\u2019s tool, the onager was the maul:
    slower, harder to steer, but decisive when the task was to make walls flinch
    and men on parapets scatter. When it fired, the frame jumped, dust shook from
    the sod, and somewhere downrange a square of daylight opened where stone had
    not let daylight through before."

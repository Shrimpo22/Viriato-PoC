# Viriato — Proof of Concept (POC)

Historically informed, culturally localized action-RPG prototype set around Viriato era and key Iberian sites.  
This POC validates the core loop (discover → interpret → act), the in-game **Codex** (unlockable short pages tied to discoveries).
> This repository complements the MSc thesis document by providing the playable POC build and the author-written scripts referenced throughout the thesis.
> For the reasons explained in the document, any referenced commercial content cannot be made available.
